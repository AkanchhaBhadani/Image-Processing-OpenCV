## **IMAGE MASKING**

Image Masking is a powerful technique in OpenCV and Image Processing. Mask allows us to focus on the portions of the image that interest us. Here in this notebook we have the image of a cartoon and we are interested in her face only so we do image masking. After applying image masking we get the face of the cartoon and the rest of the image is masked.
